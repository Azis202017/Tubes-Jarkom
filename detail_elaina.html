    <h1>Detail Elaina</h1>
    <p>
      When she was a young girl, Elaina wanted to travel around the world. As
      such, she decided to study so she could become a witch. When she turns 14
      years old, Elaina passes the sorcery exam, becoming an apprentice witch.
      She then approaches the witches in the country in order to be their
      disciple, but she is rejected. Afterward, Elaina overhears her parents
      talk about the "Stardust Witch" who lives in the forest. Heading there,
      she meets the Stardust Witch, who is named Fran. She is surprised when
      Fran agrees to train her. However, for a month, all Elaina does is chores.
      When Fran gives Elaina a test, she overwhelms her, which causes Elaina to
      become despondent. Fran then reveals that her parents asked her to teach
      her about failure and setback. She decides to train Elaina for real. A
      year later, Elaina becomes a full-fledged witch. After an emotional
      sendoff, Elaina leaves her home. It is then revealed that Elaina has been
      traveling for three years.
